# This playbook **YUM UPDATES** EC2 instances for SIWAPP.
# It REQUIRES instances to have the following tags:
# - Application: this will be set to 'siwapp' for all instances
# - Pod: pod_number is defined in the vars section below and is used to allow
#   creation of multiple pods for a lab environment
#
# It is recommended to set the ANSIBLE_FORKS environment variable (or add it to
# your ansible.cfg) to the number of instances created so that yum updates of
# all instances can occur in parallel. The ansible default for forks is 5,
# which is too low. To check if forks has been changed from the default:
#         ansible-config dump --only-changed
